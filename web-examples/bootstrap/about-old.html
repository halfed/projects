Sleasman, PC is a forward-thinking Certified Public Accounting Firm that 		                                provides a wide array of services and has strong collaborative working relationships                                with other accounting firms.  The firm includes William J. Sleasman, Certified Public                                 Accountant; Allen Tanner; and Janice Sleasman.  We provide services to a diversified                                clientele.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our mission for the past 30 years has been to provide our clients with "Beyond Routine                                 Services."  We serve and fill those needs with accurate and timely service.    We go                                 one step beyond providing them with more than many other firms provide. Our clients                                count on us and we are there for them.
							</p>
							<p>
								We believe that clients need non-traditional services in addition to traditional 							                                services, to succeed and excel.  Non-traditional services include meeting with clients                                 to clearly define their goals and helping them to achieve them.  We do this by using                                alternate means of providing financial information and staying in touch with our                                clients when they need us.
